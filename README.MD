### Hi There. I did this repository on 05/2020 during the Corona Times (quarantine) when i've stayed most of the times at home.

Basically I've decided to make a big review regarding the Technologies I work with (C#, Angular...) and the Methodologies like
OOP, DDD, SOLID, Design Patterns. Sometimes it's good to take some time to review what you are doing ;)

So basically you'll find lot of information, questions and answers, some projects and also some IMGs on this folder that contains
some info about what I'm studying, and also to serve me as a reference in the future. My Goals here are:

**C#**:
SOLID Principles (Done) <br>
C# TOP Questions/Principles (Done) <br>
C# Review for Async/Await (Progress...) <br>
C# first app for RABBITMQ and Messaging (To-Do) <br>
Unit Tests Eduardo Pires (To-Do) <br>
MicroServices (ver v√≠deo Eduardo) <br>

**OOP, Architecture, Design Patterns, Principles**:
Rest and Restful principles <br>
Agile <br>

**Angular**:
Angular Redux / Promisses (Async/Await) (To-Do) <br>
Angular TOP Questions/Principles (To-Do) <br>

**DevOps**:
Azure Serverless (study Azure, see some course) <br>
Docker Envoirnment for AppFullStackDemo (To-Do) <br>
