**Response Compression**:
Asp.Net Core already contains a Framework to Compress the Response. It's on Microsoft.AspNetCore.ResponseCompression. You have to configure it on
Startup and Services, you'll see on this sample how to do it. I've attached inside folder "CompressionSample" a project with a sample and below the
LINK to this article. This Algorith will use by default "Gzip", but there's other called "Deflate".

You can TEST the responses on Imsomnia (it shows the bytes) or even with an app called Fiddler.
