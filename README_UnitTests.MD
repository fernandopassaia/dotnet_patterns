### Hi There. Document for Unit Tests

**Principle of Technique Red-Green Refactory**:
(1) First of All I'll write dowm ow my test-names with "Assert.Fail()". I'll made all my tests fail. Then, So for example: If i have 12 tests, I'll have 12 fails.
(2) Then I'll go to Green, make this tests PASS with minimal work as possible. It will be a mass, because I'll replicate code of one in another one...
(3) Then I'll refactor the code, making the code easy to maintanence.
